** Networking **

OSI Model
Layer 1: Physical
Layer 2: Data Link
Layer 3: Networking
Layer 4: Transport
Layer 5: Session
Layer 6: Presentation
Layer 7: Application



** Layer 1: Physical **

Key Words:
- Physical Medium: copper (electrical), fiber (light), Wifi (radio frequency)
- Raw Bitstreams
- NIC (Networking Interface Cards)
- Hub
- Collision

What it has:
- Physical shared medium
- Standards for transmitting onto medium
- Standards for recieiving from medium

What it lacks:
- No access control
- No uniquely identified devices
- Lots of collisions

** Layer 2: Data Link **

Key Words:
- MAC Header : Preamble, Destination MAC address, Source MAC address, ET (Ether Type), Payload, FCS (Frame Check Sequence)
- Media Access Control (MAC)
- Frames
- CSMA (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access)
- Encapsulation 
- Switch
- MAC address table
- Decimal/Binary conversion: dotted decimal notation, bits, bytes, octets

What it has:
- Identifiable devices
- Media Access Control for sharing
- Collision Detection becaus eof CS (Carrier Sense)
- Unicast (1:1)
- Broadcast (1:ALL)
- Switches (smart hubs)

What it lacks:
- Moving data between different local networks

** Layer 3: Networking **

Key Words: 
Internet Protocol (IP)
Local Area Network (LAN)
Wide Area Network (WAN)
Hops
Frame encapsulation
Point to point link
Packet Structure: Source IP, Destination IP, Data, TTL/ Hop Limit
Protocols: TCP (6), ICMP/ Ping (1), UDP (17)
IPv4: TTL (Time To Live)
IPv6: Hop Limit
IP addressing
Subnet Masks/ CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
Route Tables, Routes, Router
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)


What it has:
- Device to device communication over the internet with help of IP addresses, ARP, route, route tables, router

What it lacks:
- No methods for channels of communications (can't have 2 applications using the same source and destination IP)
- Can be delivered out of order
- No ensuring of packet arrival (Packets can get lost)
- IP has no flow control (can saturate destination causing packet loss)

** Layer 4 **

Key Words:
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Segments: source port, destination port, sequence number, acknowledgement, flags, window, urgent pointer, checksum, data
Ephemeral Port
Well Known Port
3 way handshake: Synchronize (SYN), Synchronize- Acknowledge (SYN-ACK), Acknowledge (ACK), Close (FIN)

What it has:
- Allows multiple applications to use the same source and destination IP
